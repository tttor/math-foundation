# 2.1 Intro
* Goal: to compute the probability of an event

# 2.2 Sample space and events
* Sample space $S$ of the experiment: the set of all possible outcomes of an experiment
  * Example 3:
    If the experiment consists of flipping two coins, then the sample space
    consists of the following four point:
    $S = \{ (H, H), (H, T), (T, H), (T, T) \}$
* Event $E$:
  * is any subset of the sample space
  * is a set consisting of possible outcomes of the experiment
  * In example 3:
    if $E = \{ (H, H), (H, T) \}$, then $E$ is the event that a head appears on the first coin
  * If the outcome of the experiment is contained in $E$,
    then we say that $E$ has occured
* Union of the event $E$ and $F$
  * consists of all outcomes that are either in $E$ or in $F$ or in both
  * is denoted by $E \cup F$
* Intersection of the event $E$ and $F$
  * consists of all outcomes that are both in $E$ and in $F$
  * is denoted by $E \cap F$, or simply $EF$
  * If $EF = \emptyset$, then $E$ and $F$ are said to be mutually exclusive
* Complement of $E$
  * consists of all outcomes in the sample space $S$ that are not in $E$
  * is denoted by $E^c$
* Subset and superset
  * For any two events $E$ and $F$, if all of the outcomes in $E$ are alse in $F$,
    then we say that $E$ is contained in $F$, or $E$ is a subset of $F$, and
    write $E \subset F$ (or equivalently, $F \supset E$)
  * If $E \subset F$ and $F \subset E$, we say that $E$ and $F$ are equal
    and write $E = F$
  * Illustrate the logical relations among events using the Venn diagram
* The operations of forming unions, intersections, and complemenets of events
  obey certain rules similar to the rules of algebra,
  * For example, commutative, associative, and distributive laws
  * Also recall the DeMorgan's laws
