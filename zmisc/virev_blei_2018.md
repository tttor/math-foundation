## abs
* variational inference (VI ), a method from machine
learning that approximates probability densities through optimization
*  The idea behind VI is 
  * to first posit a family of densities and 
  * then, to find the member of that family which is close to the target. 
    (Closeness is measured by Kullback-Leibler divergence)
* VI is powerful, but it is not yet well understood.
